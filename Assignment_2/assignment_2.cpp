/* parse_sailing(input_line)
   Given a string containing a line from the input file, convert the
   data in the line to a Sailing instance and return the complete
   Sailing object.

   If the line cannot be parsed successfully, the function will throw
   an exception instead of returning a complete Sailing object.
   The function may not throw ANY exceptions (directly or indirectly) besides
   the ones listed below.

   Your code must check for errors in the order they are listed below.
   For example, if the line has errors in both case 1 and case 2, the
   function will throw the exception for error case 1 (and never check
   case 2).

   When an exception is thrown for a particular error, your code must
   populate the exception object with the appropriate data (see the description
   of each object above).

   Error cases:
    1. If the line contains the wrong number of fields, throw an exception
       of type IncompleteLineException. There should be 11 fields, separated by
       commas (so there should be 10 commas in a line with the correct number of
       fields).
    2. If any of the fields in the line is empty (i.e. length zero) or contains
       only whitespace, throw an exception of type EmptyFieldException. You
       can check whether a single character is whitespace using std::isspace,
       and can use std::isspace in a loop to test whether an entire string is
       whitespace.
    3. If any of the numeric fields (route number, year, month, day, hour,
       minute, expected duration, actual duration) do not begin with
       numeric data (e.g. if one of those fields contains the text "abcd"
       "a123b" or "ab123"), throw an exception of type NonNumericDataException.
       Note that a field which begins with a number and contains non-numeric
       data afterward (e.g. "123abc") is not an error (and should be parsed
       as the number 123); this is for programming convenience (since that
       case is harder to detect).
    4. If the departure time fields (hour and minute) do not comprise a valid
       24-hour time, throw an exception of type InvalidTimeException.

   If none of the above errors occurred, store the parsed data into a Sailing
   object and return that.

   Advice: Create some extra functions to help with the various subtasks
           involved in this function, rather than putting all of the code
           in one place.

/* performance_by_route(sailings)
   Given a vector of Sailing instances (in no particular order), return
   a vector of RouteStatistics instances, with exactly one entry in the result
   vector for each unique route number in the input vector.

   To be clear, there may be many sailings in the input vector with a particular
   route number (e.g. 3), but each route number must appear in only one entry
   of the result vector.

   Each RouteStatistics object will also contain the total number of sailings
   and total number of late sailings on each route.

   Recall from the specification that a "late" sailing is any sailing
   that took at least five minutes longer than expected. That is, a sailing
   where
     actual_duration >= expected_duration + 5

   Return value:
     A vector of RouteStatistics objects, in any order, where each route number
     appearing in the input vector is represented by exactly one RouteStatistics
     instance in the result.

/* best_days(sailings)
   Recall that a sailing is considered "late" if
    actual_duration >= expected_duration + 5

   Generally, a day with a large number of late sailings is a "bad day" for
   travellers.

   The "best days" are any days in the dataset for which the ratio
     late_sailings/total_sailings
   is the lowest (in the best possible case, there will be zero late sailings,
   and the ratio will equal zero).

   Given a vector of Sailing objects, this function returns a vector of
   DayStatistics objects for all of the "best days" in the dataset, which
   are all days in the dataset that have the lowest ratio of late sailings
   to total sailings.
   Note that there may be multiple such days.

   Return value:
     A vector of DayStatistics objects, in any order, where each element of the vector
     corresponds to a different date (meeting the criteria of "best days" above).
     If the input vector of sailings is empty, the return value will be an empty vector.

   and the ratio will equal one).

   Given a vector of Sailing objects, this function returns a vector of
   DayStatistics objects for all of the "worst days" in the dataset,which
   are all days in the dataset that have the highest ratio of late sailings
