# Strings

## Exercise 1 (Warmup)

Write a program that repeats a string `n` times.

### Example of output

```
string = "hello"
times = 5

output = "hellohellohellohellohello"
```

## Exercise 2 (Shuffle)

Write a program that prompts the user for a stirng. Print the stirng in reverse order

### Example of output

```
  Enter string:
  > of that im sure

Reverse is string: erus mi taht fo
```



## Exercise 3 (Palindromes)

Write a program that prompts the user for a string and checks (and prints) if it is a palindrome. That is "a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward".
Example: `madam` or `nurses run`. Note that, as in the second example, spaces (and capitalization) should be ignored.

### Example of output

```
  Enter string:
  > madam

madam is a palindrome
```



## Exericse 4 (Word Frequencies)

Write a program which reads a string and prints the word frequency for each word.



### Example of output

```
Input
> sally sells seashells by the seashore
she sells seashells on the seashell shore
the seashells she sells are seashore shells

Word Frequencies:
sally 1
sells 3
seashells 3
by 1
the 3
seashore 2
she 2
on 1
seashell 1
shore 1
are 1
shells 1
```
