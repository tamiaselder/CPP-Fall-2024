# Overview

This assignment aims to complete the implementation of a class called `StudentDB`, which maintains records of students and courses, including which students are enrolled in which courses and what grades have been assigned. The class also provides functionality to compute the average grade across all of a student's courses or those enrolled in a particular course.

Each `StudentDB` instance functions as a database that stores data (added by calling functions like `add_student` and enroll) and can provide various views on the data by calling its member functions. For example, the `student_transcript_by_course` can be used to retrieve a record of courses taken by a student and the best grade received among all the times the student took each course.

The `StudentDB` object will keep track of enrollments (where a student has registered for a particular course for a specific term) and assigned grades. Sometimes, a student may be enrolled in a course without being assigned a grade. A specific course may be oï¬€ered in multiple terms (and have a distinct set of students each term). Students may enroll in the same course in multiple
terms (and may receive a separate grade for each enrollment).

The file `assignment_3.cpp` contains the specification of the `StudentDB` class, each required public member function, and empty placeholders for each member function. You must implement all member functions and add private members to the class definition in `assignment_3.cpp` as needed. You are not permitted to modify any provided function signatures or add other public members to the `StudentDB` class beyond those provided.

**Important**: Testing your implementation is your responsibility, but a basic tester program has been provided in the `main` function to get you started. When your code is tested, shorter purpose-built testers will be used for each test case instead of a single long test program. You may modify the `main` function for your own testing, but you must ensure that your code compiles against the unmodified `main` function before submitting.

## Implementation Advice

Many of the required member functions have significant overlap in their expected behaviour. If you implement each function to call other member functions if needed, you can save a large amount of redundant work.

For example, the `courses_taken_by_student` function is relatively simple to implement if it calls the `get_student_enrollment_records` function. The two functions to compute averages are much more straightforward if written to call other functions to gather their data before computing the average.

## Task (50pt)

Implement all necessary functions.


## Code Requirements

- You must ensure that your code compiles against the unmodified version of the `main` function before submitting.
- The goto statement is not permitted in any assignment submissions.
- Global variables (data variables created outside of the scope of a function) are not permitted,
- Every function with a non-void return type must return a value.
